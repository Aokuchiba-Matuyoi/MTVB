This repository contains the implementation of the method described in the paper "Manipulation Mask Generator: High-Quality Image Manipulation Mask Generation Method Based on Modified Total Variation Noise Reduction" by Yinan Lin and Xing Wei.

The project proposes an automated pipeline for generating high-quality image manipulation masks using a modified Total Variation (TV) noise reduction technique combined with Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). The method leverages real-world tampered images from Baidu PS Bar to create a large-scale dataset for deep learning-based tampering detection.
